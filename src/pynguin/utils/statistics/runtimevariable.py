    A runtime variable is either an output of the generation (e.g., obtained coverage)
    or something that can only be determined once the CUT is analysed (e.g., number of
    branches).

    It is perfectly fine to add new runtime variables in this enum, in any position, but
    it is essential to provide a unique name and a description for each new variable,
    because this description will become the text in the result.
